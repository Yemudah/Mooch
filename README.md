# Flask Dynamic Form Handling Project

This project is a Flask web application that demonstrates dynamic routing, form handling, and database integration using SQLAlchemy. The application supports different routes with custom forms and processes submissions by saving data to an SQLite database.

## Features

- Dynamic routing based on configuration.
- Forms with various field types and validation.
- Submission of form data stored in a SQLite database.
- Display of submitted data in a table format.

## Project Structure

```
/project-root
    /templates
        index.html
    /static
        styles.css
    app.py
    requirements.txt
    example.db
```

### Files and Directories

- `app.py`: The main Flask application script.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for rendering dynamic content and forms.
- `static/styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
- `example.db`: SQLite database file.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database:**

   The database will be initialized automatically the first time you run the app. No additional steps are needed to set up the database.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Navigate to Routes:**

   - **/about**: Displays content related to "About" with a form for user input.
   - **/contact**: Displays content related to "Contact" with a form for user input.
   - **/love**: Displays content related to "Love" with a form for user input.

3. **Submit Forms:**

   Each route has its own form. Fill in the required fields and submit the form. The submitted data will be saved to the database and displayed on the index page.

4. **View Submitted Data:**

   Access the index page at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view all submitted form data.

## Configuration

The project uses a single handler for form submissions, which dynamically processes and stores the form data based on the route. The routes and their respective forms are configured in the `app.py` file.
